## Build and publish

Using [AWS Amplify](https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/) to automatically build and publish the site.

* Using git flow model, make changes in a branch or fork
* When ready for a release, ush or merge to `develop` branch and AWS will build it to a test [feature version](https://develop.dh5yumej29mt8.amplifyapp.com/) of the site.
* After functionally testing and things are looking good, merge to `production` branch for public version of the site which is also automatically built and published.
* Push or merge to any other branch for no automation.

### Developer Quick Start

* `npm run build` builds the project - this builds assets, HTML, JS, and CSS into `dist`
* `npm run clean` deletes the `dist` directory to prepare for rebuilding the project
* `npm start` or `npm run start` runs the project, launches a live preview in your default browser, and watches for changes made to files in `src`

### Developer Advanced Tasks

* `npm run build:assets` copies the files in the `src/assets/` directory *into `dist`
* `npm run build:pug` compiles the Pug located in the `src/pug/` directory into `dist`
